# DIT-FFT-AND-DIF-FFT-ALGORITHMS
The radix-2 DIF-FFT and DIT-FFT algorithms are FFT algorithms that compute
DFT of a sequence using a divide-conquer approach. The DIT FFT algorithm computes the transform recursively in a top-down manner, while the DIF FFT algorithm computes the transform recursively in bottom-u and both use the butterfly operation. These algorithms were implemented in python
